## Code Complexities:

### Handling Multiple States:
- Tracking multiple states of the rice cooker (ricePresent, riceCooked, steamingInProgress, heatingInProgress), increasing the complexity of function logic.

### Use of Synchronous Delay Loops:
- The `delaySync()` function uses a synchronous delay loop, potentially blocking code execution and making the application unresponsive during the delay.

### User Choice Handling Structure:
- User choice management with conditional statements (`if-else` or `switch`) might contain redundancies or repetitive sections in the option processing logic.

### Complex Dependencies Among States:
- Various rice cooker functions (`addRice()`, `cookRice()`, etc.) have intricate dependencies among states, complicating code understanding and maintenance.

### Limited User Input Validation:
- User input validation is limited to converting to an integer (`parseInt`) without handling other error cases or unexpected inputs.

### Infinite Loop in Simulation:
- The simulation (`simulateRiceCooker()`) uses an infinite `while` loop, potentially causing prolonged execution issues.

## Implemented Simplifications:

### Use of Return Statements to Halt Execution:
- Functions (`steam()`, `keepWarm()`) use return statements to halt execution as soon as a condition is met, avoiding unnecessary processing.

### Restructuring Choice Logic with Switch:
- User choice management is enhanced by using a `switch` structure instead of a series of `if-else` statements, making the code more readable and understandable.

### Optimization of State Reset:
- `removeRice()` utilizes `Object.assign` to reset the rice cooker states in a single line, simplifying the reset process.

### Improved User Input Handling:
- The use of `parseInt` and a `switch` structure for user choices is an improvement over simple integer conversion, allowing better management of invalid inputs.
